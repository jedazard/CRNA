# CRNA
Causal Regulatory Network Analysis (CRNA)


===============
### Description

Performs an integrative Causal Regulatory Network Analysis (CRNA) of system level measurements (He at al. 2020).

### Details

Causal Regulatory Network Analysis (CRNA) explains observed gene expression changes by a causal pattern under a given experiment. 
Recent approaches use a pre-established Knowledge Base to extract the regulatory network that is consistent with Differentially 
Expressed Genes (DEGs) in a given study. However, these methods consider all information in their Knowledge Base, regardless of 
the experimental context, leading to inconsistencies in regulatory network predictions. An efficient and effective method is needed 
to deliver regulatory annotations and activity analyses from system level expression measurementsof high-throughput data such as 
generated by Genomics, Proteomics, or Metabolomics studies. 

We introduce a novel Causal Regulatory Network framework to predict a causal pattern of events for the provided systems under study 
and infer Genes/Proteins activities. Given a directed Knowledge Base network of Gene-Gene or Protein-Protein interactions, we provide 
a tunable parametric graphical model, based on network-searching algorithms, to build a causal regulatory network and infer plausible 
scores/states of Genes/Proteins activity. We assess the predicted upstream regulators at the Gene/Protein level and regulatory paths 
at the sample and phenotype level. Finally, we report the regulatory network with predicted activity score/state for each Gene/Protein 
assessed in the study. Simulation results also show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy of regulatory nodes in the final 
network of Genes/Proteins. 

Our framework addresses several issues prevalent in Causal Regulatory Network analysis methods. First, we provide the necessary tuning 
technique of model parameters by cross-validation to avoid the common risks of over and under fitting in graphical models. Second, 
we improve on the inconsistencies in activity states that are often observed in these models. Moreover, our method can predict activity 
scores/states for Genes/Proteins and paths for an individual sample or multiple measurements of the same phenotype, which can also be 
used to assess the quality of samples, providing flexibility for downstream analyses.
