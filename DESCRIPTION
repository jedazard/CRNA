Description: A comprehensive tool to deliver accurate regulatory annotations and activity analyses from system-level expression measurements of high-throughput data such as those generated by genomics, proteomics, or metabolomic studies. Given a directed Knowledge Base network of Gene-Gene or Protein-Protein interactions, the package provides a tunable parametric graphical model, based on network-searching algorithms, to build a causal regulatory network and infer plausible scores/states of genes/proteins activity. Our method assesses the predicted upstream regulators at the gene/protein level and regulatory paths at the sample and phenotype level.
